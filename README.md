Exploring Private / Local Development Networks
It connects to a local horizon instance at http://localhost:10000 by default. If you are running a local private network for development this is quite handy for browsing your changes to the ledger.
Alternatively you can run locally connecting to the testnet or public network horizon instances. To do this define these aliases to localhost:
127.0.9.1  testnet.local     # for steexp use testnet horizon
127.0.9.1  publicnet.local   # for steexp use mainnet horizon
Navigate to http://testnet.local:9000 or http://publicnet.local:9000 to select the network your interesting in exploring.
Development
See the section Exploring Private / Local Development Networks for connecting to different backend networks. By default steexp will look for a local instance of horizon. 
also you can run locally connecting to testnet or public network horizon instance. A fear wall for posting ideas, services, goods for sales to team up for exploring with people with same ideas.
